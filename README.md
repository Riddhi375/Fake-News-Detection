📌 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
📖 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles as Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The model is trained on labeled news data and uses text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification algorithms to detect fake news.

🚀 Features

Text preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming)

TF-IDF vectorization

ML models (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / etc.)

Model accuracy evaluation

Prediction on custom news input

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

NLTK
